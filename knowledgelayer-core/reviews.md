# Reviews

Teachers in KnowledgeLayer build their reputation over time through receiving Reviews from students that have enrolled in their courses.

A Review is an ERC 721 soulbound NFT that is associated with a KnowledgeLayer ID. New Reputation NFTs can be minted whenever a course is completed on KnowledgeLayer. They include information about the course completed and a review from the student. A KnowledgeLayer ID can have an unlimited number of Reputation NFTs, that are aggregated and portable across any platform.
