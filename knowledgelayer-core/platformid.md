# PlatformID

## What is a Platform ID?

A Platform ID is the identity of a platform on KnowledgeLayer. It allows a platform to onboard users to the protocol and allow them to perform functionality such as creating courses, buy courses and more.

A Platform ID allows for configuration of several fees.

### originFee

The fee that a platform takes when a course that was created on the platform gets sold (even if it's sold on another platform).

_The default configuration of this fee is 0%._&#x20;

### buyFee

The fee that a platform takes when a course that is purchased on the platform (even if it was created on another platform).

_The default configuration of this fee is 0%._&#x20;

### postingFee

Because platforms may desire to levy fees on course creation, KnowledgeLayer will offer an optional configurable course posting fee.&#x20;

_The default configuration of this fee is 0%._&#x20;

## Protocol Fee

This fee is used to support the development of the KnowledgeLayer protocol. It is sent to the KnowledgeLayer treasury. The treasury is currently managed by the KnowledgeLayer team and will eventually be transitioned to be managed by the eventual KnowledgeLayer DAO.&#x20;

_This fee is set at 1%._
