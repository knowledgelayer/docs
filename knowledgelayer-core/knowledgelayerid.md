# KnowledgeLayerID

## What is a KnowledgeLayerID?

KnowledgeLayer ID is the identity of learners and teachers interacting with KnowledgeLayer-integrated platforms, that aggregates their educational history and reputation across many platforms.

KnowledgeLayer IDs ERC-721 NFTs that live inside crypto wallets; this means that reputation is self-custodied by the wallet owner and lives separately from integrated platforms. KnowledgeLayer IDs are “soul-bound” in that they can not leave the originating wallet unless a recovery is initiated.

## Role-Agnostic IDs

Unlike some educational platforms, separate accounts are not needed to enroll in courses and create courses. We are all both learners and teachers.

## KnowledgeLayer ID Handles

Your KnowledgeLayer ID Handle is a unique string of characters and numbers that you can choose when you create your KnowledgeLayer ID. This handle is how others can search for you in the ecosystem.

You can have a maximum of 31 characters in your KnowledgeLayer ID and use only low characters, numbers and - or \_.

**Choose wisely:** Make sure you choose your handle carefully - after your ID has been initiated, your handle can not be changed.
