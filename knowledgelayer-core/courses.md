# Courses

KnowledgeLayerCourse is the smart contract that creates instances of courses and allows users to buy them. The Course Registry is a searchable on-chain repository of courses that can be posted to and read from by any integrated platform.

Courses are referenced in the on-chain registry within the smart contract and their content is encrypted and uploaded on IPFS.

Each course is a token instance of an ERC1155 contract. Users can buy the course by minting the corresponding token. The minted NFT gives access to the course content by enabling its decryption.
