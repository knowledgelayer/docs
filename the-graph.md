# The Graph

KnowledgeLayer provides querying mechanisms by using the tools provided by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/). The [KnowledgeLayer Subgraph](https://github.com/knowledgelayer/knowledgelayer-subgraph) is the implementation of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) that should be used to query KnowledgeLayer data. The data that can be queried is defined by [the Subgraph Schema](https://github.com/knowledgelayer/knowledgelayer-subgraph) and can be explored using [the GraphQL explorer](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/knowledgelayer/knowledgelayer-mumbai).
