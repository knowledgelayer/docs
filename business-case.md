## Higher Liquidity Means Increased User Loyalty

Right now, users of educational platforms resort to maintaining multiple accounts across many platforms because they can‚Äôt find sufficient resources or counter-parties on just one platform. This is the crux of the ‚Äúchicken and egg‚Äù problem in marketplaces.

Most teachers are not able to make enough earnings on a single platform, so they need to use multiple platforms. This fragments their reputation across platforms, hurting their trustability.

Students often can't find enough learning resources on one platform, and are then forced to use multiple, making it difficult to manage their access to resources and fragmenting their educational history and achievements across several accounts. Moreover, there is no standardized way of issuing certificates across these platforms.

Using multiple platforms means:

* Users deal with more friction when it comes to maintaining accounts and finding resources or counter-parties
* Users are forced to use multiple platforms, when they‚Äôd rather use just one

**Bringing higher liquidity of users and content to your platform means users will stay because they don‚Äôt NEED to move. This leads to improved user experience, more revenues, and increased user loyalty for your platform.**

## Higher Liquidity Means More Courses Being Done

Through increasing liquidity of users and content on your platform, you reduce friction in finding the right resources for students, and in making enough sales for teachers. With higher liquidity, more courses can being taken on your platforms; this in turn leads to more revenues for you and your team.

Providing more efficient education platforms can benefit all of us, unlocking potential for flourishing as humans.
